    <h1> A World in Conflict </h1>

    <div id='intro'>
      <p>
        Some of the most tragic events in human history have taken place in the context of great conflicts. The human tendency to settle disputes with violence is not a new one, but as technology has developed and historic tensions have festered, this predilection for violence permeates our times with vigor and has made a palpable fear descend on our world and its people.

        This series of visualizations seeks to make apparent the prevalence of war in international affairs. With data from the <a href='https://ucdp.uu.se/'>Uppsala Conflict Data Program</a>, we show patterns of conflict from 1946 &mdash; 2017. Explore these visualizations to see how war has shaped our world and understand the scale of its impact in the modern era.
