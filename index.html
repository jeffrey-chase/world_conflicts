      <p>
        Some of the most tragic events in human history have taken place in the context of great conflicts. The human tendency to settle disputes with violence is not a new one, but as technology develops and historic tensions  fester, this predilection for violence permeates our times with a renewed vigor.

        This series of visualizations seeks to make apparent the prevalence of war in international affairs. With data from the <a href='https://ucdp.uu.se/' target="blank">Uppsala Conflict Data Program</a>, we show patterns of conflict from 1946 &mdash; 2017. Explore these visualizations to see how war has shaped our world and understand the scale of its impact in the modern era.

      <h3>Conflict over Time</h3>
      <div class='description'>
        <p>
          This timeline shows the trends of conflicts over time both interstate (between countries) and intrastate (between multiple actors within one country). The timeline is divided between major conflicts (those with &gt; 1000 casualties) and minor conflicts (those with &lt; 1000 and &gt; 25 casualties).
        </p>
        <p>
          The timeline has all of the conflicts in the dataset in order. Each stack represents the set of conflicts in that year. Some of these conflicts may be over incompatibilities that date back to earlier conflicts. Because of this, the start date listed may be before the year the data point is in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explore the data by using the search toolbar to find a specific country in the list (note that countries in the list may not appear in the chart, if they did not have any conflicts). Click a country in the dropdown menu as you type to select it. Hover over a conflict to show more specific information about it including what type of conflict it was and the specific actors involved.

      <div class="description">

        <p>
          This map shows the countries in the dataset that have fought in a conflict with another country since 1946. Countries colored darker red are those which have fought in more conflicts. The country with the most conflicts was India with 25 total.

      <h3>The War Network</h3>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          This force directed edge-link diagram shows the warful connections between the countries in the dataset. Countries are represented as individual nodes and links represent conflicts between those two countries with thicker links representing more common conflict pairs. This graph focuses on the primary actors in the conflicts to show clusters of enemies and visualize the tangled network of international conflict among countries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pull the nodes to separate clusters from one another and explore the connections between countries and the shape and connectivity of the various clusters and their members.

      <h3> Connections in Conflict </h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          This adjacency matrix visualizes how various countries have been connected across conflicts. The rows and columns are duplicated, with a colored cell at the intersection between them indicating a connection. The darker the color, the more times they have been in a conflict/alliance together (depending on which button is pressed).
        </p>
        <p>
          Hover over the matrix to have the axis lines move to indicate where that point intersects with the countries on the axes.
